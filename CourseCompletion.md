# Course Completion

## What I&#39;ve Learned

I learned how to create my [GitHub profile README](https://github.com/ChanEddyW/ChanEddyW/blob/main/README.md).

Using [Warren&#39;s README](https://github.com/walters954/walters954/blob/main/README.md) as an example helped.

I also did my first pull request.

## What I Struggled With

Getting emojis into the README markdown file was a struggle at first.

Then I discovered this gist [Complete list of github markdown emoji markup](https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908) where I can copy and paste emoji.

## What I Think Can Be Improved

I am not completely new to markdown, Git, GitHub&mdash;so I can go through this course without much trouble.

If I put myself into the shoes of a beginner, I think more steps in a certain order would help so that a student won&#39;t be completely lost on how to&#58;
